As shown above, `app1.css` and `app2.css` have the same size.

Even though `app2` only have a few class usage...ðŸ˜¢

As a work-around, you need to overwrite bundled assets by Vite like this to optimize.

```
NODE_ENV=production ./node_modules/.bin/tailwindcss -i ./app2/style.css -o ./dist/assets/app2.74ba676f.css --minify --purge ./app2/**/*.jsx
```
